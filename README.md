# OCTheme
A better dark theme (in my eyes) for One Commander. Inspired by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I wish I could use similar colors in my browser, but alas, I cannot.

This is work in progress, don't expect everything to look nice :)

# How to install

1. Clone the repository in your One Commander Themes directory.
2. Choose the theme from the configuration dialog.
